# Replication-of-human-limb-motion-in-real-time
In our daily life, we see objects, which are made up of particles in space. We define the location of any particle by using a 3D coordinate system. Every object takes a specific location in the space in the form of (x,y,z) points. To define the movement of a particle, we need its position and its motion.
In this project, our motive is to study the motion of limbs and to replicate that motion in software and to measure muscular stress value from the signals generated by the muscles of the hand while picking up a weight. Then to infer a result from these collected data.

In this project, real-time replication of human upper limb motion is carried out, with the help of Arduino and sensors. This project can be a part of Robotic Arm, in which it can be used to give real-time instructions to robotic arm, by the use of the final outcome of this project.
